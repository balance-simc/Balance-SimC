1. What's new? <a href="https://github.com/balance-simc/Balance-SimC/commits/master/faq.txt" target="_top">(changelog)</a>
    * All sims are updated for Patch 9.2.

1. How do I use the new charts?
    * The main sims page on [Dreamgrove](https://dreamgrove.gg/sims) has brief instructions on how to use various parts of the chart to look at the information you want.

1. What are the base profiles used in the sims?
    * All raid buffs and consumables are used.
    * 'Smart Sim' setting is used for each set of talents with a fixed soublind & legendary. This means that for each soulbind & legendary combo, the talents that sim highest will be more precise than the talents that sim the lowest.
    * Stellar Flare talent is filtered out by default. It can be re-filtered in by clicking the down arrow on the T45 filter.
    * The base character can be found in [sandbag_h_base.txt](sandbag_h_base.txt) for heroic level and [sandbag_base.txt](sandbag_base.txt) for mythic level.
        * Heroic:
            - Legendary items are set with Haste & Mastery at ilevel 265
            - Conduits are Rank 11 + 2 (enhanced)
            - T28 2-set is equipped
            - Only one legendary is equipped at a time
        * Mythic:
            - Legendary items are set with Haste & Mastery at ilevel 291
            - Conduits are Rank 13 + 2 (enhanced)
            - T28 2+4-set are equipped
            - The Unity legendary is being used for all profiles at ilevel 291

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an approximation of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

2. What is the '2T Spread' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This represents an encounter with two targets which are by 15 yards so Starfire and Moonfire /w Twin Moons talent cannot hit both targets at the same time.

1. What is the 'Composite' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random highly variable encounter as often found in dungeons. The simc raid_events can be found in [composite.txt](composite.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~550s total fight time
        * ~115s to ~160s fighting one boss mob
        * ~20s to ~40s fighting waves of 1 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random ~5s to ~25s wait after each fight

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * Convoke the Spirits will cast:
        - 5 to 6 heals
        - 20% chance to replace a damage spell with Full Moon
        - Strong likelihood of casting 3-5 starsurges
        - Almost guaranteed chance to cast starfall if it isn't up
        - Chance to cast Moonfire on an un-dotted target

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC makes the following assumptions:
        - You are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you
        - 27.75% of the pool is discounted to approximate loss due to absorb/healing/desync of damage patterns between the two players
        - The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you
